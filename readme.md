# Tweeter

Have your tweets written by AI.  
Directly in the browser.

[tweeter.nico.dev](https://tweeter.nico.dev)

## How it works
Tweeter uses [WebLLM](https://github.com/nico-martin/web-llm) to load and run common Large Language Models compiled with [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm) directly in the browser using WebGPU.

It is mainly to play around with different LLMs and see how they they perform in the browser.

For now it supports the following models:
- Llama-2-7b-chat
- Mistral-7b-instruct
- RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-3B-v1
